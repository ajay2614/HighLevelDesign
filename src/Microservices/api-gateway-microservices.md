## 1. Introduction to Microservices Architecture {#introduction}

### What is Microservices Architecture?

Microservices architecture is a software implementation methodology where an application is composed of various small, individual, independently deployable services that perform one unit of a particular business function exclusively.

### Key Characteristics

**Modularity**
- Application functionality is divided into many smaller services that run independently
- Each service contributes to a common task
- Supports easier and faster creation and delivery to market

**Scalability**
- Microservices can be scaled independently based on demand
- System can distribute resources smoothly by upward or downward scaling
- Only the services that need scaling are affected, not the entire application

**Technology Diversity**
- Different services can use different technologies, programming languages, and frameworks
- Teams can choose the best tool for each particular job
- Allows for gradual technology migration and modernization

**Independent Deployment**
- Services can be deployed independently without affecting other services
- Enables continuous deployment and delivery (CI/CD)
- Faster delivery of features and updates to production

**Fault Isolation**
- Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- Problems are contained within service boundaries
- Enhances overall system resilience

## 2. API Gateway Pattern {#api-gateway}

### What is an API Gateway?

An API gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for all client requests in a microservices architecture. It sits between clients and backend microservices, routing requests to the appropriate service and aggregating responses.

### Main Features of API Gateway

**Reverse Proxy / Gateway Routing**
- Provides a single endpoint or URL for client applications
- Internally maps requests to a group of internal microservices
- Helps decouple client apps from microservices
- Supports gradual migration from monolithic to microservices architecture

**Request Aggregation**
- Aggregates multiple client requests targeting multiple internal microservices into a single client request
- Client app sends one request to the API Gateway
- Gateway dispatches several requests to internal microservices
- Aggregates results and sends everything back to the client
- Reduces chattiness between client apps and backend API
- Especially important for remote apps (mobile, SPAs)

**Authentication and Authorization**
- Centralizes authentication logic
- Validates API keys, OAuth tokens, JWT tokens
- Offloads authentication responsibility from microservices
- Provides an extra layer of security

**Rate Limiting and Throttling**
- Controls number of requests a client can make within a specified timeframe
- Prevents API overuse and DoS attacks
- Ensures fair resource distribution among users
- Uses algorithms like Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window, or Sliding Window

**Caching**
- Stores frequently accessed data to improve performance
- Reduces load on backend services
- Decreases response latency
- Supports TTL (Time-To-Live) based expiration

**Load Balancing**
- Distributes incoming requests across multiple service instances
- Supports various algorithms: Round Robin, Least Connections, Resource-aware
- Ensures high availability and reliability
- Prevents any single instance from becoming a bottleneck

**Request/Response Transformation**
- Modifies request headers, query parameters, or body
- Transforms response format to match client expectations
- Supports API versioning and backward compatibility

**Monitoring and Analytics**
- Tracks API usage metrics and patterns
- Provides insights into performance and errors
- Enables real-time monitoring and alerting
- Supports debugging and troubleshooting

### API Gateway Design Patterns

**Centralized Edge Gateway**
- Single API gateway at the edge of the system
- Routes all incoming requests
- Simple to implement and provides single entry point
- Can become a bottleneck if not properly scaled
- Best for: Small to medium applications

**Two-Tier Gateway**
- Client-facing gateway at the edge
- Backend gateway routes to appropriate services
- Separates concerns for security and scalability
- Best for: Enterprise applications with complex security requirements

**Backend for Frontend (BFF)**
- Separate gateway for each client type (web, mobile, IoT)
- Tailored APIs for specific client needs
- Optimizes experience for each platform
- Best for: Applications with multiple client types

**Microgateway**
- Each microservice has its own dedicated API gateway
- Service-specific traffic control
- More complex to manage but highly flexible
- Best for: Large-scale distributed systems

**Sidecar Gateway (Service Mesh)**
- Sidecar proxy deployed alongside each service
- Part of service mesh architecture
- Provides service-to-service communication features
- Best for: Cloud-native applications with complex service interactions

### API Gateway Best Practices

1. **Keep Gateway Lightweight**: Avoid adding business logic to the gateway
2. **Use Declarative Routing**: Define routes in configuration files
3. **Implement Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
4. **Enable Caching Wisely**: Cache only appropriate responses
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track latency, error rates, and throughput
6. **Version Your APIs**: Support multiple API versions for backward compatibility
7. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Return meaningful error messages
8. **Use Asynchronous Processing**: For long-running operations

## 3. Multi-Region and Availability Zone Deployment {#multi-region}

### Understanding Geographic Distribution

**Region**
- A geographic area containing multiple isolated data centers
- Examples: us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-2
- Regions are physically separated by significant distances
- Each region is completely independent
- Used for disaster recovery and global distribution

**Availability Zone (AZ)**
- One or more discrete data centers within a region
- Each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- Connected through low-latency private networks
- Isolated from failures in other AZs within the same region
- Typically 2-6 AZs per region

### Deployment Approaches

**Single Region, Single AZ Deployment**
- Simplest deployment model
- Lowest cost but highest risk
- No protection against AZ failures
- Use case: Development/testing environments

**Single Region, Multi-AZ Deployment (Zone-Redundant)**
- Services distributed across multiple AZs within one region
- Synchronous data replication between AZs
- Automatic failover to healthy AZs
- Protects against AZ-level failures
- Low latency between AZs (typically < 2ms)
- Use case: Production applications requiring high availability

**Multi-Region Deployment**
- Services deployed across multiple geographic regions
- Active-Passive or Active-Active configurations
- Asynchronous data replication between regions
- Higher complexity and cost
- Protects against region-level failures
- Reduces latency for global users
- Use case: Global applications, disaster recovery

### Zone-Redundant Deployment Strategy

**Application Tier**
- Application instances spread across multiple AZs
- Load balancer distributes traffic across AZs
- Built-in service load balancer disperses requests across instances
- If one AZ experiences outage, traffic automatically redirected

**Storage Tier**
- Data copies distributed across multiple AZs
- Synchronous replication ensures consistency
- Transaction complete only when written to multiple AZs
- Each AZ maintains up-to-date copy of data
- Automatic failover to healthy AZ

**Key Benefits**
- Increased resilience to datacenter outages
- Zero data loss within region (synchronous replication)
- Automatic failover without manual intervention
- Transparent to application users

**Considerations**
- Slightly higher latency due to synchronous replication
- Higher cost due to redundant resources
- May impact highly latency-sensitive workloads

### Multi-Region Deployment Strategy

**Active-Passive Configuration**
- Primary region handles all traffic
- Secondary region(s) on standby for failover
- Data replicated asynchronously to secondary regions
- Manual or automatic failover during primary region failure
- Lower cost than active-active
- Some data loss possible (due to async replication)
- Use case: Disaster recovery, regulatory compliance

**Active-Active Configuration**
- Multiple regions actively processing requests
- Users routed to nearest region (latency-based routing)
- Load distributed across all regions
- Complex data synchronization required
- Highest availability and performance
- Higher operational complexity
- Use case: Global applications, maximum uptime requirements

**Traffic Management in Multi-Region**

*DNS-based Routing (Route 53, Cloud DNS)*
- Latency-based routing: Route to nearest region
- Geoproximity routing: Based on user and resource locations
- Weighted routing: Control traffic distribution percentages
- Failover routing: Automatic failover to healthy regions

*Global Load Balancer*
- Layer 7 (Application) load balancing
- Intelligent routing based on application state
- Real-time health checks
- Automatic traffic shifting during failures
- Examples: Azure Front Door, Google Cloud Load Balancing, AWS Global Accelerator

### Communication Patterns in Multi-Region/AZ

**Intra-AZ Communication**
- Services within same AZ communicate directly
- Lowest latency (sub-millisecond)
- No cross-AZ data transfer costs
- Preferred for chatty services

**Cross-AZ Communication**
- Services in different AZs within same region
- Low latency (1-2ms typically)
- Incurs data transfer charges
- Use load balancers to abstract AZ details

**Cross-Region Communication**
- Services in different regions
- Higher latency (50-300ms depending on distance)
- Higher data transfer costs
- Use API Gateway or edge services
- Implement circuit breakers and timeouts

### Handling Regional Failures

**Service-Level Failover**
- Each service can failover independently
- Service-specific DNS records and health checks
- Allows partial failover (only affected services)
- Reduces blast radius of failures

**Application-Level Failover**
- Entire application fails over as a unit
- Coordinated DNS updates across all services
- Simpler to manage but less flexible
- Appropriate for tightly coupled services

**Failover Best Practices**
1. Implement comprehensive health checks at each regional endpoint
2. Use Circuit Breaker pattern to detect persistent failures
3. Set appropriate health check intervals (e.g., 10 seconds)
4. Define failure thresholds (e.g., 3 consecutive failures)
5. Test failover regularly through disaster recovery drills
6. Monitor failover metrics and latency impacts
7. Implement graceful degradation where possible

### Data Consistency Across Regions

**Eventual Consistency**
- Updates propagate asynchronously
- Short delay before all regions consistent
- Better performance and availability
- Acceptable for most use cases

**Strong Consistency**
- All regions see same data simultaneously
- Significant performance impact
- Required for financial transactions, inventory

**Strategies**
1. Use distributed databases with built-in replication (DynamoDB Global Tables, Cosmos DB)
2. Implement Conflict Resolution policies
3. Use Event Sourcing for audit trail
4. Employ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
5. Implement Saga pattern for distributed transactions

- Caller waits for response before proceeding
- Direct coupling between services
- Uses HTTP/HTTPS (REST, gRPC)

**When to Use**
- Immediate response required
- Simple CRUD operations
- User-facing operations
- Low-latency requirements

**Advantages**
- Simple to implement and understand
- Immediate feedback
- Easy debugging and tracing
- Natural for request-response workflows

**Disadvantages**

- Improved scalability
- Temporal decoupling (services don't need to be available simultaneously)

**Disadvantages**
- More complex to implement
- Eventual consistency challenges
- Harder to debug
- Requires message infrastructure

**Communication Patterns**

*Message Queue*
- Point-to-point communication
- Message consumed by single consumer
- Guarantees message delivery
- Examples: RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Azure Service Bus

*Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub)*
- One-to-many communication
- Multiple subscribers receive same message
- Broadcasting events
- Examples: Apache Kafka, AWS SNS, Google Pub/Sub

*Event Streaming*
- Continuous stream of events
- Events stored for replay
- Multiple consumers can process at different rates
- Event sourcing and CQRS support
- Examples: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Azure Event Hubs

### Hybrid Communication

Many real-world systems use both patterns:
- Synchronous for user-facing operations requiring immediate response
- Asynchronous for background processing, notifications, and integrations

**Example Flow**
1. User places order (synchronous REST call)
2. Order service validates and confirms (synchronous response)
3. Order service publishes "OrderCreated" event (asynchronous)
4. Payment service processes payment (async)
5. Inventory service updates stock (async)
6. Notification service sends email (async)

## 5. Service Discovery and Load Balancing {#service-discovery}

### Service Discovery

Service discovery is the automatic detection of services and their network locations in a microservices architecture.

**Why Service Discovery?**
- Services instances scale up and down dynamically
- IP addresses and ports change frequently
- Manual configuration doesn't scale
- Need automatic registration and discovery

**Service Discovery Patterns**

- Lower latency

*Disadvantages*
- Client must implement discovery logic
- Tight coupling with discovery mechanism
- Language-specific implementations

**Server-Side Discovery**
- Client makes request to load balancer/API Gateway
- Load balancer queries service registry
- Load balancer routes to appropriate instance
- Examples: Kubernetes Services, AWS ELB

| Consistency | Eventual | Strong | Eventual |
| Multi-Region | Requires setup | Built-in | Via federation |
| Health Checks | Heartbeat | Comprehensive | Liveness/Readiness probes |
| Load Balancing | Client-side | Both | Server-side |
| Storage | In-memory | Persistent | etcd |

### Load Balancing Strategies

**Load Balancing Algorithms**

**Round Robin**
- Distributes requests sequentially across instances
- Simple and fair distribution
- Doesn't account for instance load
- Best for: Homogeneous instances with similar capacity

**Weighted Round Robin**
- Assigns weights to instances
- Distributes traffic proportionally to weights
- Useful during gradual rollouts
- Best for: A/B testing, canary deployments

**Least Connections**
- Routes to instance with fewest active connections
- Accounts for actual instance load
- Better for long-lived connections
- Best for: WebSocket, streaming connections

**Least Response Time**
- Routes to instance with lowest latency
- Requires response time monitoring
- Adapts to instance performance
- Best for: Performance-critical applications

**IP Hash**
- Uses client IP to determine instance
- Ensures same client always reaches same instance
- Provides session affinity
- Best for: Stateful applications, session persistence

**Resource-Based**
- Routes based on CPU, memory metrics
- Most intelligent but complex
- Requires real-time monitoring
- Best for: Heterogeneous instance types

**Topology-Aware (Zone/Region-Aware)**
- Prefers instances in same AZ/region
- Minimizes latency and data transfer costs
- Falls back to other zones if needed
- Best for: Multi-AZ deployments

### Load Balancing Layers

## 6. Data Management in Microservices {#data-management}

### Database Per Service Pattern

Each microservice has its own exclusive database, ensuring independent operation without shared database.

**Key Principles**

**Service Independence**
- Each service owns and manages its data
- No direct database access from other services
- Data access only through service APIs
- Schema changes don't impact other services

**Data Encapsulation**
- Data fully encapsulated within microservice
- Strong boundaries between services
- Clear ownership and responsibility

**Technology Choice**
- Each service can use most suitable database type
- SQL for transactional data
- NoSQL for documents, time-series, graphs
- Optimize for specific service needs

**Independent Scaling**
- Databases scale independently based on service needs
- No resource contention between services
- Optimize each database separately

**Resilience and Fault Isolation**
- Database failure in one service doesn't affect others
- Blast radius contained within service boundary
- Better overall system resilience

**Advantages**
1. Loose coupling between services
2. Technology diversity and flexibility
3. Independent deployment and scaling
4. Clear service ownership
5. Better fault isolation

**Challenges**
1. Data consistency across services
2. Complex queries spanning multiple services
3. Data duplication and synchronization
4. Increased operational overhead
5. Transaction management complexity

### Managing Distributed Transactions

**The Problem**
- Traditional ACID transactions don't work across services
- No distributed transaction coordinator
- Each service has independent database
- Need alternative approaches for consistency

### Saga Pattern

A saga is a sequence of local transactions where each service performs its operation and triggers the next step. If a step fails, compensating transactions undo completed steps.

**Characteristics**
- Sequence of local transactions
- Each transaction updates one database
- Publishes event/message to trigger next step
- Compensating transactions for rollback
- Ensures eventual consistency

**Types of Saga Implementation**

**Choreography-Based Saga**
- Decentralized coordination
- Each service publishes events after local transaction
- Other services subscribe and react to events
- No central coordinator

*Advantages*
- Simple for simple workflows
- Good for loosely coupled services
- No single point of failure

*Disadvantages*
- Difficult to understand complex workflows
- Cyclic dependencies risk
- Hard to debug and monitor

**Orchestration-Based Saga**
- Centralized coordinator (Saga Execution Coordinator)
- Coordinator tells services what operations to perform
- Services report back completion
- Coordinator manages compensation logic

*Advantages*
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Centralized monitoring
- Better error handling
- Clear workflow definition

*Disadvantages*
- Coordinator can be bottleneck
- Central point of failure
- Additional component to manage

**Example: E-commerce Order Processing**

Order → Payment → Inventory → Shipping

*Success Flow*
1. Order Service: Create order (local transaction)
2. Payment Service: Process payment (local transaction)
3. Inventory Service: Reserve items (local transaction)
4. Shipping Service: Create shipment (local transaction)

*Failure Flow (Payment fails)*
1. Order Service: Create order ✓
2. Payment Service: Process payment ✗
3. Compensate: Order Service cancels order

**Saga Best Practices**
1. Design idempotent operations
2. Implement compensating transactions
3. Use semantic locks for pessimistic scenarios
4. Log all saga steps for debugging
5. Implement timeout mechanisms
6. Design for eventual consistency
7. Provide status visibility to users

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separates read and write operations into different models.

**Command Side (Write)**
- Handles create, update, delete operations
- Optimized for writes
- Strong consistency
- Validates business rules

**Query Side (Read)**
- Handles read operations
- Optimized for queries
- Eventually consistent
- Denormalized views
- Can use different database technology

**Benefits**
- Independent scaling of reads and writes
- Optimized data models for each operation
- Better performance
- Flexibility in query implementations

### Event Sourcing

Store sequence of events rather than current state.

**Concept**
- Every state change captured as event
- Events are immutable and append-only
- Current state derived by replaying events
- Complete audit trail

**Benefits**
- Complete history of changes
- Time travel (reconstruct state at any point)
- Event replay for debugging
- Natural fit with event-driven architectures

**Challenges**
- Complexity in implementation
- Storage requirements
- Event versioning
- Query complexity

## 7. Resilience Patterns {#resilience}

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services.

**States**

**Closed State**
- Normal operation
- Requests pass through
- Monitors failure rate
- If failures exceed threshold, transitions to Open

**Open State**
- Circuit "tripped"
- All requests fail immediately
- No calls to downstream service
- After timeout period, transitions to Half-Open
- Gives failing service time to recover

**Half-Open State**
- Limited number of test requests allowed
- If successful, transitions back to Closed
- If failures continue, returns to Open
- Validates service recovery

**Configuration Parameters**
- Failure threshold (e.g., 50% error rate)
- Timeout period (e.g., 30 seconds)
- Number of test requests in half-open state

**Use Cases**
- Protecting against slow or unresponsive services
- Preventing resource exhaustion
- Failing fast during outages
- Third-party service integrations

### Retry Pattern

Automatically retries failed operations to handle transient failures.

**Best Practices**

**Exponential Backoff**
- Wait longer after each retry
- Example: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s
- Prevents overwhelming recovering service

**Jitter**
- Add randomness to retry delays
- Prevents thundering herd problem
- Staggers retries from multiple clients

**Retry Limits**
- Cap maximum number of retries (e.g., 3)
- Avoid infinite retry loops
- Fail after exhausting retries

**Idempotency**
- Ensure operations safe to repeat
- Use idempotency keys for critical operations
- Prevents duplicate processing

**Combine with Circuit Breaker**
- Retry for transient failures
- Circuit breaker for persistent failures
- Best of both patterns

**Use Cases**
- Network timeouts
- Temporary service unavailability
- Database connection issues
- Rate limiting errors

### Bulkhead Pattern

Isolates resources to prevent cascading failures.

**Concept**
- Like watertight compartments in ships
- Separate resource pools for different operations
- Failure in one pool doesn't affect others
- Limits blast radius

**Implementation Types**

**Thread Pool Isolation**
- Separate thread pools for different services
- Each service gets fixed number of threads
- Prevents one service from exhausting all threads

**Semaphore Isolation**
- Limits concurrent requests per service
- Lightweight compared to thread pools
- Suitable for high-throughput scenarios

**Connection Pool Isolation**
- Separate database connection pools
- Prevents one service from monopolizing connections

**Use Cases**
- Protecting critical services
- Managing third-party dependencies
- Resource-intensive operations
- Multi-tenant systems

### Timeout Pattern

Prevents indefinite waiting for responses.

**Best Practices**
- Set realistic timeouts based on SLAs
- Different timeouts for different operations
- Network timeout < service timeout < client timeout
- Always specify explicit timeouts (don't rely on defaults)

### Fallback Pattern

Provides alternative response when primary operation fails.

**Fallback Strategies**
- Return cached data
- Return default values
- Degrade gracefully with limited functionality
- Queue request for later processing
- Return friendly error message

**Example**
- Product recommendations service fails
- Fallback: Show popular products instead
- User experience maintained

### Health Check Pattern

Monitors service health for routing and recovery decisions.

**Types of Health Checks**

**Liveness Probe**
- Is the service running?
- Used to detect crashed services
- Triggers service restart if failing

**Readiness Probe**
- Is the service ready to accept traffic?
- Checks dependencies (database, cache)
- Removes from load balancer if not ready

**Startup Probe**
- Has service completed initialization?
- Useful for slow-starting services
- Prevents premature liveness failures

**Health Check Endpoints**
- `/health`: Overall health
- `/health/live`: Liveness
- `/health/ready`: Readiness
- Return HTTP 200 (healthy) or 503 (unhealthy)

## 8. Security in API Gateway {#security}

### Authentication Mechanisms

**API Keys**
- Simple authentication method
- Client includes key in header or query parameter
- Easy to implement but less secure
- Suitable for internal APIs or MVP
- Challenges: Key rotation, sharing

**OAuth 2.0**
- Industry standard for authorization
- Token-based authentication
- Supports multiple grant types
- Delegated access without sharing credentials
- Separates authentication and authorization

**OAuth 2.0 Flows**
1. Authorization Code (web applications)
2. Client Credentials (service-to-service)
3. Resource Owner Password (legacy)
4. Implicit Grant (deprecated, use Authorization Code + PKCE)

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- Self-contained tokens
- Contains claims about user
- Digitally signed (prevents tampering)
- Stateless (no server-side session storage)
- Can be verified without calling auth service

**JWT Structure**
```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

*Header*: Token type and signing algorithm
*Payload*: Claims (user ID, permissions, expiration)
*Signature*: Ensures integrity

**JWT Validation**
1. Verify signature using public key
2. Check expiration (exp claim)
3. Verify issuer (iss claim)
4. Verify audience (aud claim)
5. Check not-before time (nbf claim)

**Mutual TLS (mTLS)**
- Client and server both authenticate
- Certificate-based authentication
- Strong security for service-to-service communication
- Common in service mesh implementations
- Requires certificate management infrastructure

### Authorization

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Users assigned to roles
- Roles have permissions
- Simple and widely understood
- Example: Admin, User, Guest

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
- Access based on attributes
- User attributes, resource attributes, environment
- More flexible than RBAC
- Complex policy evaluation

**Policy-Based Authorization**
- Centralized policy definitions
- Declarative authorization rules
- Tools: Open Policy Agent (OPA), Casbin

### API Gateway Security Features

**Rate Limiting**
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Per-user, per-IP, or per-API key limits
- Protects backend services
- Ensures fair usage

**IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting**
- Allow/deny specific IP addresses or ranges
- Network-level security
- Useful for internal APIs

**Request Validation**
- Validate request format and schema
- Reject malformed requests at gateway
- Prevent injection attacks
- Reduce load on backend services

**Response Filtering**
- Remove sensitive data from responses
- Enforce data privacy
- Apply field-level security

**SSL/TLS Termination**
- Gateway handles SSL/TLS encryption
- Backend services communicate over HTTP
- Centralized certificate management
- Reduces backend complexity

### Security Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTPS**: Encrypt data in transit
2. **Implement authentication**: Don't rely on obscurity
3. **Use strong authorization**: Principle of least privilege
4. **Rate limit aggressively**: Protect against abuse
5. **Validate all inputs**: Defense in depth
6. **Log security events**: Audit trail for investigations
7. **Keep secrets secure**: Use secret management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
8. **Rotate credentials regularly**: Minimize exposure window
9. **Implement CORS carefully**: Don't use wildcard in production
10. **Use security headers**: X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS

## 9. Deployment Strategies {#deployment}

### Blue-Green Deployment

**Concept**
- Two identical production environments: Blue (current) and Green (new)
- Deploy new version to Green environment
- Test thoroughly in Green
- Switch traffic from Blue to Green
- Blue becomes standby for next deployment

**Advantages**
- Zero downtime deployment
- Instant rollback (switch back to Blue)
- Complete testing before production traffic
- Reduced deployment risk

**Disadvantages**
- Requires double infrastructure (higher cost)
- Database schema changes challenging

- When instant rollback needed
- When you can afford duplicate infrastructure

### Canary Deployment

**Concept**
- Gradually roll out new version to small subset of users
- Monitor metrics and feedback
- Incrementally increase traffic to new version
- Roll back if issues detected

**Typical Progression**
- 5% traffic → Monitor → 25% → 50% → 100%
- Or: Internal users → Beta users → 10% → 50% → 100%

**Advantages**
- Reduced risk (limited blast radius)
- Real production testing
- Gradual rollout allows monitoring
- Easy to halt if problems detected

**Disadvantages**
- More complex to implement

- Customer-facing applications
- When you want real-user feedback
- Gradual performance validation

### Rolling Deployment

**Concept**
- Update instances gradually, one or few at a time
- Replace old version with new version incrementally
- No additional infrastructure needed
- Both versions run during deployment

**Advantages**
- No extra infrastructure required
- Gradual deployment
- Can pause if issues arise

**Disadvantages**
- Both versions running simultaneously
- Longer deployment time
- Harder to rollback
- Complex for database migrations

**Use Cases**
- Regular updates

## 10. Service Mesh Architecture {#service-mesh}

### What is a Service Mesh?

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that manages service-to-service communication transparently. It handles traffic management, security, and observability without requiring code changes.

**Problem it Solves**
- Service-to-service communication complexity
- Security (mTLS) across all services
- Observability and tracing
- Traffic management and routing
- Retry and circuit breaker logic

**Without Service Mesh**
- Each service implements own logic
- Code duplication across services
- Language-specific implementations
- Inconsistent behavior
- Hard to update policies

**With Service Mesh**
- Centralized policy enforcement
- Consistent behavior across services
- No code changes required
- Platform-level capabilities

### Service Mesh Architecture

**Data Plane**
- Consists of lightweight proxies (sidecars)
- Deployed alongside each service instance
- Intercepts all network traffic
- Enforces policies
- Collects telemetry
- Most common: Envoy proxy

**Control Plane**
- Manages and configures proxies
- Distributes policies
- Collects telemetry
- Service discovery
- Certificate management
- Configuration API

### Istio Architecture

Istio is the most popular open-source service mesh.

**Components**

**Istiod (Control Plane)**
- Pilot: Traffic management, service discovery
- Citadel: Certificate and credential management
- Galley: Configuration management
- Single control plane component (simplified)

**Envoy (Data Plane)**
- High-performance C++ proxy
- Layer 7 (application) proxy
- HTTP/2, gRPC support
- Advanced load balancing
- Circuit breakers
- Health checks
- Rich metrics

**How It Works**
1. Service A wants to call Service B
2. Request intercepted by Service A's Envoy sidecar
3. Envoy applies policies (auth, rate limit)
4. Envoy routes to Service B instance
5. Request received by Service B's Envoy sidecar
6. Envoy validates mTLS certificate
7. Request forwarded to Service B
8. Response flows back through Envoys
9. Both Envoys collect metrics

### Service Mesh Capabilities

**Traffic Management**
- Request routing (path, header-based)
- Load balancing
- Timeout and retry configuration
- Circuit breaking
- Traffic splitting (canary, A/B testing)
- Traffic mirroring
- Fault injection for testing

**Security**
- Automatic mTLS between services
- Authentication (verify identity)
- Authorization (access control)
- Certificate management
- Secure service-to-service communication
- No code changes required

**Observability**
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Service graph visualization (Kiali)
- Access logs
- Real-time traffic monitoring

### Service Mesh Benefits

1. **Security**: Automatic mTLS encryption
2. **Observability**: Deep insights without instrumentation
3. **Traffic Control**: Advanced routing without code changes
4. **Resilience**: Built-in circuit breakers and retries
5. **Policy Enforcement**: Centralized and consistent
6. **Developer Productivity**: Focus on business logic

### Service Mesh Challenges

1. **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure component
2. **Performance Overhead**: Proxy adds latency (1-3ms)
3. **Learning Curve**: New concepts and tools
4. **Operational Overhead**: More components to manage
5. **Resource Consumption**: Sidecars require CPU/memory

### When to Use Service Mesh

**Good Fit**
- Large number of microservices (>10-20)
- Complex service-to-service communication

**Not Recommended**
- Small number of services (<5)
- Simple architectures
- Performance-critical (low-latency requirements)
- Limited operational capacity
- Monolithic or few services

---

## 11. Observability and Monitoring {#observability}

### Three Pillars of Observability

**Logs**
- Timestamped records of events
- What happened and when
- Structured (JSON) or unstructured (plain text)
- Examples: Application logs, access logs, error logs
- Tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Loki

**Metrics**
- Numeric measurements over time
- System and application performance
- Time-series data
- Examples: CPU usage, request rate, latency, error rate
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, InfluxDB

**Traces**
- Request journey through distributed system
- Shows service interactions
- Identifies bottlenecks and failures
- End-to-end transaction visibility
- Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry

### Why Observability Matters

**Challenges in Microservices**
- Many services to monitor
- Distributed nature makes debugging hard
- Failures can cascade
- Performance issues span services
- Root cause analysis complex

**Benefits of Good Observability**
- Faster issue detection
- Quicker root cause identification
- Better understanding of system behavior
- Proactive problem prevention
- Data-driven optimization

### Monitoring with Prometheus

**What is Prometheus?**
- Open-source monitoring and alerting system
- Pull-based metrics collection
- Time-series database
- Powerful query language (PromQL)
- Built-in alerting

**Architecture**
- Prometheus Server: Scrapes and stores metrics
- Exporters: Expose metrics from systems
- Pushgateway: For short-lived jobs
- Alertmanager: Handles alerts
- Grafana: Visualization (separate tool)

**Metrics Types**
- Counter: Monotonically increasing (requests served)
- Gauge: Can go up or down (CPU usage)
- Histogram: Distribution of values (latency buckets)
- Summary: Similar to histogram (quantiles)

**Example Metrics**
```
http_requests_total
http_request_duration_seconds
service_up
database_connection_pool_size
```

**PromQL Examples**
```
# Request rate (requests per second)
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# 95th percentile latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, http_request_duration_seconds)

# Error rate
rate(http_requests_total{status="500"}[5m])
```

### Visualization with Grafana

**What is Grafana?**

**Common Dashboards**
- Application metrics (request rate, latency, errors)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Business metrics (orders, revenue, users)
- Service-level indicators (SLIs)

### Distributed Tracing

**Concept**
- Tracks request as it flows through system
- Each service adds span (operation within trace)
- Spans connected to form complete trace
- Shows timing and relationships

**Trace Components**
- Trace ID: Unique identifier for request
- Span ID: Unique identifier for operation
- Parent Span ID: Links spans together
- Tags: Metadata (service name, HTTP method)
- Logs: Events within span

**Benefits**
- Identify slow services
- Find bottlenecks
- Understand dependencies
- Debug distributed failures
- Measure end-to-end latency

**Tools: Jaeger**
- Open-source distributed tracing
- Created by Uber
- Compatible with OpenTracing
- Visualization UI
- Sampling strategies

**Tools: Zipkin**
- Open-source distributed tracing
- Created by Twitter
- Simple architecture
- Wide language support

**OpenTelemetry**
- Unified observability framework
- Standardized APIs and SDKs
- Vendor-neutral
- Combines tracing, metrics, logs
- Successor to OpenTracing and OpenCensus

### Centralized Logging

**Why Centralized Logging?**
- Services distributed across many nodes
- Need single place to search logs
- Correlate logs from multiple services
- Long-term storage and analysis

**ELK Stack**
- Elasticsearch: Search and analytics engine
- Logstash: Log processing pipeline
- Kibana: Visualization and exploration

**Architecture Flow**
1. Services write logs (stdout or files)
2. Log shippers collect logs (Filebeat, Fluentd)
3. Logs sent to processing pipeline (Logstash)
4. Logs indexed in Elasticsearch
5. Users query and visualize in Kibana

**Logging Best Practices**
1. Use structured logging (JSON format)
2. Include correlation IDs (trace requests)
3. Log appropriate level (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
4. Don't log sensitive data
5. Include contextual information
6. Log errors with stack traces
7. Use consistent timestamp format

### Health Checks and Monitoring

**Service Health Checks**
- Liveness: Is service alive?
- Readiness: Can service handle requests?
- Health endpoint returns service status

**Synthetic Monitoring**
- Proactive monitoring
- Simulate user behavior
- Test critical workflows
- Detect issues before users

**Real User Monitoring (RUM)**
- Monitor actual user experience
- Frontend performance
- User journey tracking
- Geographic distribution

**Alerting Best Practices**
1. Alert on symptoms, not causes
2. Use meaningful thresholds
3. Avoid alert fatigue
4. Include context in alerts
5. Define clear escalation paths
6. Test alert mechanisms
7. Review and refine alerts regularly

### Communication Patterns

**Synchronous (REST/gRPC)**
- API Gateway → Services: REST
- Service-to-service queries: gRPC
- Timeout: 5 seconds
- Retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

**Asynchronous (Events)**
- Order processing workflow: Kafka events
- Notifications: RabbitMQ queues
- Analytics: Kafka streaming

**Example Flow: Place Order**

1. User clicks "Place Order" (Web/Mobile App)
2. Request → API Gateway (JWT validation, rate limiting)
3. API Gateway → Order Service (REST, synchronous)
4. Order Service:
   - Validates order
   - Creates order record (DB write)
   - Returns order ID to user (HTTP 201)
   - Publishes OrderCreated event (Kafka, async)
5. Payment Service:
   - Subscribes to OrderCreated
   - Processes payment with payment gateway
   - If success: Publishes PaymentProcessed
   - If failure: Publishes PaymentFailed → Saga compensation
6. Inventory Service:
   - Subscribes to PaymentProcessed
   - Reserves inventory
   - If sufficient: Publishes InventoryReserved
   - If insufficient: Publishes InventoryInsufficient → Saga compensation
7. Shipping Service:
   - Subscribes to InventoryReserved
   - Creates shipment
   - Publishes ShipmentCreated
8. Notification Service:
   - Subscribes to OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed, ShipmentCreated
   - Sends emails at each stage
9. User receives confirmation in <200ms
10. Background processing completes in <5 seconds

### Resilience Implementation

**Circuit Breakers**
- Applied to all external calls
- Threshold: 50% error rate over 10 requests

- Payment gateway: 50 threads
- Notification service: 20 threads
- Analytics: 10 threads

**Timeout Configuration**
- API Gateway → Services: 5s
- Service → Database: 3s
- Service → External API: 10s
- Circuit breaker timeout: 30s

**Fallback Strategies**
- Recommendations: Popular products if service unavailable
- Search: Cached results if Elasticsearch down
- Notifications: Queue for later if service unavailable

### Security Implementation

**Authentication**
