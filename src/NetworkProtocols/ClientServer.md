1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

Purpose: Communication between web browsers/clients and web servers.
Used for websites, web apps, and REST APIs.
Ports: 80 / 443 (HTTPS)
Communication Type: One-way / Half-duplex — client initiates request, server responds.
Stateless: each request is independent.
HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Examples: POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
username=ajay&password=1234
Key Points: Login pages and form submissions always use HTTP/HTTPS, not FTP.
HTTP PUT/POST are web methods, not the same as FTP commands.

Analogy: Like sending a form to a web office: you fill it, submit it, and wait for a response. You don’t directly access the server’s files.

2. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Purpose: Upload and download files between client and server.
Entirely for file management, not web page login or APIs.
Ports: 21 (control), 20 (data)
Communication Type: Two-way / Full-duplex — both client and server can send/receive simultaneously via separate channels (control vs data).
FTP Commands:
USER Send username	USER ajay
PASS Send password	PASS ****
LIST List files in directory	LIST
GET / RETR	Download file	get report.pdf
PUT / STOR	Upload file	put data.csv

Example (FTP session):
ftp> open ftp.example.com
ftp> user ajay
ftp> pass ****
ftp> put report.docx
ftp> get data.csv

Key Points: FTP login uses commands, not a browser interface.
FTP PUT = upload file → different from HTTP PUT.
FTP is command-based, while HTTP is form-based/web-based.
Analogy: Like a shared folder(means: a mental model to imagine that the server has a folder you can put files into or get files from.) 
— you type commands to upload/download files.

3. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

Purpose: Sending emails from client → server or server → server.
Handles outgoing emails only. 
Ports: 25 / 587
Communication: One-way (push only)
Example:
MAIL FROM:<ajay@example.com>
RCPT TO:<user@gmail.com>
DATA
Key Points: Every email you send uses SMTP somewhere.
Tools like Gmail, Outlook, Eloqua use SMTP to send emails.
Analogy: SMTP = postal service delivering letters.

4. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

Purpose: Retrieve and manage emails stored on the server.
Keeps emails synchronized across multiple devices.
Ports: 143 / 993
Communication: Two-way (client ↔ server)
Example:
FETCH 1 BODY[TEXT]
STORE 1 +FLAGS (\Seen)
Key Points:
IMAP = protocol for reading/managing emails.
Email flow: SMTP sends → IMAP retrieves.
Analogy: Mailbox at post office — actions reflect everywhere.

Email Flow Diagram:
[Your Client / Tool] --SMTP--> [Mail Server] --SMTP--> [Recipient Server] --IMAP--> [Recipient Client]

5. WebSocket Protocol

Purpose: Real-time, full-duplex communication between client & server.
Ports: 80 / 443
Communication: Full-duplex — both sides can send/receive messages anytime
Example (JS):

const ws = new WebSocket("wss://chat.example.com");
ws.send("Hello Server");
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log(event.data);

Use Case: Chat apps, live notifications, multiplayer games
Analogy: Like a phone call — both people can talk & listen continuously.

✅ Exam / Interview Key Takeaways
HTTP PUT/POST ≠ FTP PUT
SMTP sends emails; IMAP reads/manages emails
WebSocket = real-time full-duplex communication (whatsapp)

Correct Analogies
Protocol	Correct Analogy
HTTP	Like sending a form to a web office: you fill it, submit it, and wait for a response. You don’t directly access the server’s files.
FTP	Like a shared folder where you type commands to upload/download files. You’re directly interacting with the server’s file system.
SMTP	Postal service delivering letters.
IMAP	Checking your mailbox at the post office — actions reflect everywhere.
WebSocket	Phone call — both can talk & listen continuously.
